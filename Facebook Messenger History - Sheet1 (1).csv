How was Morgan Park for you? 
There are many tracks that you need to find your flow on to go well, but finding flow can be difficult.

Over the past 7 seasons, I have been working with riders to access the flow state and peak performance more often and for longer because Flow is a science. When you know what creates it for you, you can get into that space every time you are on track.

Hope you’ve wrapped up the season feeling good about the effort you put in.

Over the past 9 seasons, I’ve had the chance to work with more than 500 racers across some of the toughest championships out there — BSB, Moto2, Moto3 and World SBK
And no matter the level, I’ve seen the same things trip riders up time and time again:
• Overthinking mid-session
• Confidence dipping when it counts
• Not performing at the level they know they can

So, I built a short End-of-Season Flow Assessment to help riders figure out exactly what’s working mentally, what’s holding them back under pressure, and how to fix it before next season kicks off.

You joined us over a year ago, since you watched my webinar on The Mental Skills Needed For Success In Motorcycle Racing. You told me in the application for the call, that confidence in your tyres and cold-starts were your biggest challenge.

So let me ask—has that mysteriously fixed itself?


Half a year on… have those nerves vanished?
If not, I’ve got something to offer you.

We’ve just opened up a few new spots in the Flow Performance Library Access – our most cost-effective way to get started. You can access real, structured performance training for just £97/month. That’s less than a tank of fuel to get you to the track.

And sitting on the fence? It’s a horrible place to be.
Once you decide, everything gets lighter—no more second-guessing, no more wondering “Can I fix this with another YouTube video?” or “Maybe it’ll just improve by itself…”

Is any of that actually working?

This isn’t another freebie or tip—it’s a system built specifically for riders like you, ready to bounce back stronger:

Just released a brand new video that dives into the 4 core pillars elite racers use to unlock podium-level consistency.
(Most riders miss one — and it’s usually the reason they’re stuck.)

If you’re still chasing consistency or know you’ve got more in you — this is gonna hit hard.

Always interested to hear how riders are getting on and what’s been working (or not!) for you out there. 🏁

Not sure if you’ve seen this yet—have you taken the Rider Mindset Profile?
It’s a free, super-accurate quiz that shows whether your mindset is costing you time… or helping you go faster.

Grab it here:

It’s been over a year since you joined us on The Mental Skills Needed for Success in Motorcycle Racing webinar 

You said you were struggling with mental approach and confidence — and your results weren’t where you wanted them to be.

So… has that changed? Or are those issues still riding with you?


If not, I’ve got something to offer you.

We’ve just opened up a few new spots in the Flow Performance Library Access – our most cost-effective way to get started. You can access real, structured performance training for just £97/month. That’s less than a tank of fuel to get you to the track.

And sitting on the fence? It’s a horrible place to be.
Once you decide, everything gets lighter—no more second-guessing, no more wondering “Can I fix this with another YouTube video?” or “Maybe it’ll just improve by itself…”

Is any of that actually working?

This isn’t another freebie or tip—it’s a system built specifically for riders like you, ready to bounce back stronger:

You’re quick.
Maybe even faster than some of the racers getting sponsored right now.

So why are they turning up with logos and backing… while you’re still paying for everything yourself?

Here’s the truth:
Talent doesn’t get you sponsored.
Structure does.

securing sponsorships is all about planning. A well-organized approach not only highlights your dedication but also simplifies for potential sponsors to see the value in partnering with you. By developing a solid proposal that outlines your goals, achievements, and vision, you'll stand out in the competitive racing world.

• Overthinking mid-session
• Confidence dipping when it counts
• Not performing at the level they know they can

You’re quick.
Maybe even faster than some of the racers getting sponsored right now.

So why are they turning up with logos and backing… while you’re still paying for everything yourself?

Here’s the truth:
Talent doesn’t get you sponsored.
Structure does.

That’s exactly what you’ll see in Fast Track to Sponsorship — a free 3-day mini course that shows you:
✅ Why sponsors aren’t biting
✅ What the top 1% of funded racers are doing differently
✅ And how to build a system that actually gets results

Stop the guesswork. Just the same structure real racers are using right now to get fully funded.

Just Reply to this message and i will get you in

Just popping back in case you missed it earlier

A bunch of riders have already jumped into the End of Season Review

And the feedback’s been wild

One messaged me after doing it and said
“I finally get why my fastest lap is always at the end of the session. Now I’ve got a clear plan to fix it”

You can stop guessing

There are 7 mistakes that struggling riders keep making time and time again, creating a loop of poor performance, frustration and even embarrassment. 

Those 7 biggest mistakes sneak up on them and take over their riding, and they keep making these mistakes without even noticing most of the time.

When they do they are not enjoying their racing as much as they used to, and they feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 

If this is you, you’re not alone, this is what most racers suffer with.

Here’s the good news...I know why.

I know exactly what is going wrong because it’s the same thing that we turn around for riders we train to race at the front of many championships.

Would you like some even better news?...

You’re quick.
Maybe even faster than some of the racers getting sponsored right now.

So why are they turning up with logos and backing… while you’re still paying for everything yourself?

Here’s the truth:
Talent doesn’t get you sponsored.
Structure does.

That’s exactly what you’ll see in Fast Track to Sponsorship — a free 3-day mini course that shows you:
✅ Why sponsors aren’t biting
✅ What the top 1% of funded racers are doing differently
✅ And how to build a system that actually gets results

Stop the guesswork. Just the same structure real racers are using right now to get fully funded.

Just Reply to this message and i will get you in

Because speed wins races — but structure wins funding.

How was Donington for you?

Donington is a track where you need to find your flow, isn't it? There are many tracks like that but finding flow can be difficult.

Over the past 7 seasons, I have been working with riders to access the flow state and peak performance more often and for longer because Flow is a science and when you know what creates it for you, you can get into that space every time you are on track.

I’ve got a few End of Season Review spots open for riders serious about unlocking that next level of speed and consistency.

You’ll get your Performance X-Ray — pinpointing where confidence and control are slipping — plus your Champion’s Roadmap to turn it into your strongest off-season yet.

Hope you’ve wrapped up the season feeling good about the effort you put in.

Over the past 9 seasons, I’ve had the chance to work with more than 500 racers across some of the toughest championships out there — BSB, Moto2, Moto3 and World SBK
And no matter the level, I’ve seen the same things trip riders up time and time again:
• Overthinking mid-session
• Confidence dipping when it counts
• Not performing at the level they know they can

So, I built a short End-of-Season Flow Assessment to help riders figure out exactly what’s working mentally, what’s holding them back under pressure, and how to fix it before next season kicks off.

How was Donington for you?

Donington is a track where you need to find your flow, isn't it? There are many tracks like that but finding flow can be difficult.

Over the past 7 seasons, I have been working with riders to access the flow state and peak performance more often and for longer because Flow is a science and when you know what creates it for you, you can get into that space every time you are on track.

I work with riders in many championships on the mental side of racing — helping them access the Flow State, where performance becomes automatic, consistent, and confident under pressure.

• Your Personal Racing DNA — understand your mental & physical patterns
• Your Champion’s Roadmap — a bulletproof plan for next season

• Confidence dipping when it counts
• Not performing at the level they know they can

There are 7 mistakes that struggling riders keep making time and time again, creating a loop of poor performance, frustration and even embarrassment. 

Those 7 biggest mistakes sneak up on them and take over their riding, and they keep making these mistakes without even noticing most of the time.

When they do they are not enjoying their racing as much as they used to, and they feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 

If this is you, you’re not alone, this is what most racers suffer with.

Here’s the good news...I know why.

I know exactly what is going wrong because it’s the same thing that we turn around for riders we train to race at the front of many championships.

Hope you’ve wrapped up the season feeling good about the effort you put in.

Over the past 9 seasons, I’ve had the chance to work with more than 500 racers across some of the toughest championships out there — BSB, Moto2, Moto3 and World SBK
And no matter the level, I’ve seen the same things trip riders up time and time again:
• Overthinking mid-session
• Confidence dipping when it counts
• Not performing at the level they know they can

As we wrap up the season, it's the perfect time to evaluate your performance. A quick mental flow assessment can help you identify strengths that will elevate your game next year. Together, we can tackle those mental hurdles and empower you to realize your full potential on the track!

Let’s take this opportunity to gear up for next season's success!",,,Nikolas Lazos #11 ,,,,

FB00214,2024-07-13 16:47:08.2 UTC,Craig Muirhead,"Hello Leon

There are 7 mistakes that struggling riders keep making time and time again, creating a loop of poor performance, frustration and even embarrassment. 

Those 7 biggest mistakes sneak up on them and take over their riding, and they keep making these mistakes without even noticing most of the time.

When they do they are not enjoying their racing as much as they used to, and they feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 

If this is you, you’re not alone, this is what most racers suffer with.

Here’s the good news...I know why.

I know exactly what is going wrong because it’s the same thing that we turn around for riders we train to race at the front of many championships.

Would you like some even better news?...

I’m going to be breaking down each 1 of these mistakes in this FREE Training

One of the biggest challenges I hear from riders—whether they’re just starting out or racing in the world championships—is that they feel fast one session, then struggle with consistency the next. That’s where the mental side of racing comes in.

Hope you’ve wrapped up the season feeling good about the effort you put in.

Over the past 9 seasons, I’ve had the chance to work with more than 500 racers across some of the toughest championships out there — BSB, Moto2, Moto3 and World SBK
And no matter the level, I’ve seen the same things trip riders up time and time again:
• Overthinking mid-session
• Confidence dipping when it counts
• Not performing at the level they know they can

As we wrap up the season, it's the perfect time to assess your performance. A quick mental flow assessment can help you identify key insights that will elevate your game next year. Together, we can tackle those challenges and empower you to achieve your full potential on the track!

One messaged me after doing it and said
“I finally get why my fastest lap is always at the end of the session. Now I’ve got a clear plan to fix it”

Because once you actually see what’s been tripping you up
You can stop guessing
And start fixing

There are 7 mistakes that struggling riders keep making time and time again, creating a loop of poor performance, frustration and even embarrassment. 

Those 7 biggest mistakes sneak up on them and take over their riding, and they keep making these mistakes without even noticing most of the time.

When they do they are not enjoying their racing as much as they used to, and they feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 

If this is you, you’re not alone, this is what most racers suffer with.

Here’s the good news...I know why.

I know exactly what is going wrong because it’s the same thing that we turn around for riders we train to race at the front of many championships.

Would you like some even better news?...

I’m going to be breaking down each 1 of these mistakes in this FREE Training

I am starting a weekly free training sessions for riders to help them ride faster, smoother, and with greater confidence, and I’m always looking for ways to bring even more value to the riding community.

I am impressed with the community you’ve built. Rather than just posting about my free training in your group, I wanted to reach out directly to explore if we could create a collaboration to offer unique value to your members.

For example, we could:
	•	Host an exclusive training session tailored to BMW S1000RR riders.
	•	Collaborate on a live Q&A, Etc.

If this sounds like something you’d like to explore, I’d be happy to discuss ideas and tailor the approach to suit your group.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! Cheers Craig",Carita Sales,FALSE,FALSE,Carita Sales,TRUE,inbox/caritasales_10230901545993845,

That’s not a skill issue — that’s mindset. And it’s fixable.

I’ve got a few End of Season Review spots open for riders serious about unlocking that next level of speed and consistency.

There are 7 mistakes that struggling riders keep making time and time again, creating a loop of poor performance, frustration and even embarrassment. 

Those 7 biggest mistakes sneak up on them and take over their riding, and they keep making these mistakes without even noticing most of the time.

When they do they are not enjoying their racing as much as they used to, and they feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 

If this is you, you’re not alone, this is what most racers suffer with.

Here’s the good news...I know why.

I know exactly what is going wrong because it’s the same thing that we turn around for riders we train to race at the front of many championships.

Would you like some even better news?...

I’m going to be breaking down each 1 of these mistakes in this FREE Training

Hope you’ve wrapped up the season feeling good about the effort you put in.

Over the past 9 seasons, I’ve had the chance to work with more than 500 racers across some of the toughest championships out there — BSB, Moto2, Moto3 and World SBK
And no matter the level, I’ve seen the same things trip riders up time and time again:
• Overthinking mid-session
• Confidence dipping when it counts
• Not performing at the level they know they can

So, I built a short End-of-Season Flow Assessment to help riders figure out exactly what’s working mentally, what’s holding them back under pressure, and how to fix it before next season kicks off.

Not sure if you know — I’m a Flow Performance Coach. A bit different from the usual rider-coach.

I work with riders in many championships on the mental side of racing — helping them access the Flow State, where performance becomes automatic, consistent, and confident under pressure.

I’ve built a free post-race assessment tool that shows exactly where your gains are hiding — and how to unlock them in time for the next round.

⚡ Want me to send it over?",,,,FALSE,FALSE,,
FB00477,2025-06-19 07:33:10.7 UTC,Craig Muirhead,"Hey Harley — thanks for taking the time to complete your IMPROVE Race Review after Croft 🔍

Most riders skip reflection — so just doing this already puts you ahead.

Here’s your breakdown:

🧠 Mindset & Goals – 90%
You were locked in and goal-driven — love it. That mental intent is a real asset. Now it's about turning that focus into consistent execution under pressure.

⚙️ Warm-Up & Prep – 71%
Solid nutrition and rehearsal are dialled, but it looks like the routine’s not always locked in. Getting consistent here is a fast way to boost confidence before you even roll out.

🏁 Free Practice – 70%
Good pace early, but connection with bike and track felt ""somewhat"" dialled. That tells us there's more potential to unlock through better flow and confidence-building drills.

⏱️ Qualifying – 65%
You achieved your goal, which is great. But frequent plateaus and a “below average” rating suggest there’s a block to break through — something we coach riders to push past.

🏆 Race Performance – 68%
You’ve got solid assertiveness and endurance. Starts and focus are areas to improve — and with just small shifts to mindset and structure, that’s very fixable.

📊 Here’s your full results page:
👉 https://improve-rider.scoreapp.com/results/684f230851d13513693532

🎥 Want to see how to fix those blocks?
Watch our free training where we walk you through the Flow Performance System — built for riders who want to get faster, more focused, and consistent across every session:

You’ve got the skills. Let’s make them repeatable — under pressure, lap after lap.

Quick one — how were the questions for you?
Helpful? Challenging? Curious what stood out most as you filled it in.

FB00479,2025-05-03 10:34:09.5 UTC,Craig Muirhead,"Hey Tommy,

Thanks again for diving into the assessment — it gives a crystal-clear view of where your riding mindset is strong and where the hidden performance gaps are holding you back.

Here's the breakdown:

🧠 Mindset – 75%
You're already showing good awareness and effort, but there's inconsistency when challenges hit. You’ve got solid self-reflection — now it’s about making that mindset automatic under pressure.

🔧 Preparation – 54%
This is where we can unlock big gains. Inconsistent routines and sleep tracking, plus no consistent rehearsal system, mean you're not starting race weekends fully loaded. Your riding is solid — but the setup isn't giving you full confidence.

⚡ Flow – 58%
You’ve felt that “in the zone” magic before — now we train it to show up when it matters most. Flow isn’t luck — it’s a skill we can build, session by session.

📈 Feedback – 58%
You’re great at seeking feedback, but you’re not locking in learnings after each session. No consistent review system = slower growth. We’ll fix that with a simple but powerful post-session routine.

🎯 Your Words: “I know I have the pace to win… but I need a mindset switch.”
That’s exactly what we work on in Flow Performance. I help riders like you go from inconsistent sparks to predictable peak performance — with confidence that sticks, even after crashes or setbacks.

I’d love to invite you to jump on a quick performance call with me. No pressure, just a chance to talk through the results, map out what your next level looks like, and see if we’d be a good fit to work together.

Want me to send over a link to book a time that works for you?


Craig",,,,,,,FALSE
FB00479,2025-05-03 12:09:43.7 UTC,Tommy Fielding Racing,"Hi Craig, thanks for taking the time to get in touch with me. I did have a look at the different pathways and thought pathway 2 would suit me best. Is that what you are suggesting too? The fact it’s a years subscription up front is a bit of a dealer breaker at the moment though, it’s a fair chunk of money to pull out.",,,,,,,FALSE
FB00479,2025-05-03 13:28:03.5 UTC,Craig Muirhead,"Hey Tommy,

Totally get where you’re coming from — and just to clarify, there is a monthly option that might suit your current situation better.

Here’s the breakdown for the £127/month plan:

🏁 Monthly Access – £127/month
✅ Full access to the Flow Performance Library
✅ Join group coaching and our elite rider community
✅ Built-in accountability and expert guidance to get real, race-day results
✅ Flexible commitment: 6-month minimum, then cancel anytime after that

⚠️ The ""In The Zone"" App isn’t included with the monthly plan (it’s a bonus on the annual), but you can still get it separately if needed.

The 6-month commitment is there because — let’s be real — real performance gains don’t happen overnight. This gives you time to lock in new habits, improve confidence, and consistently ride at your best.

If you’d prefer to spread the investment across the season, this could be the perfect way to get started — without the big up-front cost.

Hope you’ve wrapped up the season feeling good about the effort you put in.

Over the past 9 seasons, I’ve had the chance to work with more than 500 racers across some of the toughest championships out there — BSB, Moto2, Moto3 and World SBK
And no matter the level, I’ve seen the same things trip riders up time and time again:
• Overthinking mid-session
• Confidence dipping when it counts
• Not performing at the level they know they can

As we wrap up the season, it's the perfect time to reflect your performance. A quick mental flow assessment can help you identify areas for improvement that will elevate your game next year. Together, we can tackle those mental hurdles and empower you to unlock your full potential on the track!

Not sure if you know — I’m a Flow Performance Coach. A bit different from the usual rider-coach.
Instead of just focusing on technique, I work with riders on the mental side — sharpening mindset, building bulletproof pre-race prep, and getting into flow state where everything clicks.


Most racers don’t realise they’re leaving loads of time on the table — just from inconsistent focus or riding reactively under pressure.
It’s usually not the bike. It’s not fitness. It’s a mental system that’s missing.

Great to see you taking time to reflect — most riders skip this step. That alone puts you ahead of 90% of the grid.

Here’s a quick breakdown of what stood out:

🧠 Mindset & Goals – 80%
You showed up with real intent and hit your weekend goal. That belief you belong in MotoAmerica is a powerful foundation — now it’s about turning it into a repeatable mental system.

⚙️ Warm-Up & Preparation – 86%
One of your strongest areas. Stretching and mental rehearsal before sessions is elite-level behaviour. Keep building on that structure to stay calm and focused when the pressure spikes.

🏁 Free Practice – 55%
Your results suggest you’re still finding your rhythm late in sessions. That means you're likely missing early feedback opportunities. Better rehearsal techniques and mental cues can shift this fast.

⏱️ Qualifying – 82%
Strong and clear-headed — great work. Now it's about making those laps more repeatable and less dependent on ""feel good"" days.

🏆 Race Performance – 71%
Plenty to be proud of — but if starts and overtakes are still underperforming, it's usually a confidence + clarity combo. The goal is to free up your instinct and attack mode, even under stress.

FB00484,2024-07-14 17:31:20.9 UTC,Craig Muirhead,"Hello Glenn

There are 7 mistakes that struggling riders keep making time and time again, creating a loop of poor performance, frustration and even embarrassment. 

Those 7 biggest mistakes sneak up on them and take over their riding, and they keep making these mistakes without even noticing most of the time.

When they do they are not enjoying their racing as much as they used to, and they feel like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 

If this is you, you’re not alone, this is what most racers suffer with.

Here’s the good news...I know why.

I know exactly what is going wrong because it’s the same thing that we turn around for riders we train to race at the front of many championships.

Would you like some even better news?...

I’m going to be breaking down each 1 of these mistakes in this FREE Training

That kind of reflection already puts you ahead of most riders who never stop to dig into what’s really going on with their performance.

Here’s your breakdown:

🧠 Mindset & Goals – 70%
You were looking forward to the weekend and had a solid goal. That’s a good sign — but let’s make sure your goal-setting actually fuels belief and mental clarity. That’s the edge that builds confidence under pressure.

⚙️ Warm-Up & Prep – 50%
Stretching and cycling are a good start — but with fair sleep, hydration, and a “kind of prepared” feel… we’re leaving performance on the table. A locked-in pre-session routine creates the rhythm you need to hit your potential.

🏁 Free Practice – 50%
Struggled to find connection and flow. Never really got comfortable. This tells us that something’s off upstream. If FP doesn’t click, it usually means your system before hitting the track isn’t priming your brain and body the way it should.

⏱️ Qualifying – 59%
Distracted mind, plateauing, and below average results — you’re not alone. This is where many riders stall out, not because they lack speed… but because they don’t have a mental structure to clear distractions and build pressure-proof focus.

🏆 Race Performance – 61%
Solid endurance and a few positives, but low starts, low assertiveness, and stress post-session? Those are nervous system cues that you’re burning energy where you shouldn’t. This is what we help riders rewire.

Thanks again for taking the Rider Performance Assessment — it gave us a crystal-clear picture of where Liam is strong and where he’s losing lap time due to mindset and preparation gaps. 💥

From the results, it’s clear Liam has talent, drive, and ambition — but his biggest blockers right now are overthinking and a lack of consistent preparation routines to be at his best when it counts.

That’s exactly what we focus on in the Flow Performance Library Access    — helping riders like Liam stay calm under pressure, feel confident from the first lap, and race with the kind of mental system that turns frustrations into podiums 🏁.

I qualified 9th and set the fastest lap time in race 1 but got stuck in the back group and race 2 got stuck again.  

I finally started sticking to the front pack in the last race and thought I got my first 4th place but then final results showed I missed it by 0.001s and ended 5th.  Only 0.011 off a third podium position.  I loved the track and now that I was so close to a podium, I am even hungrier for it.  

I felt I was 75% of the last race in flow.  Outbreaking at every corner and just flowing.  I know I can do this and I am very determined to get a podium at One Raceway in October.  This weekend the racing was so close and in one race from 1st to 20th was only 1.5s.  We had 9 riders riding next to each other in places.  

I had a good routine during the race weekend and I was able to recap and discuss where I can improve with my Dad afterwards.

How is your season going so far? We all know that racing can come down to fine margins between success and missing out. 

One of those margins is the rider performing at their best.  We have been working with riders in many championships to access the flow state where they perform at their best. 

Discover how it works and learn about our podium-proven process to get you into flow every time you are on track

How was Donington for you?

Donington is a track where you need to find your flow, isn't it? There are many tracks like that but finding flow can be difficult.

Over the past 7 seasons, I have been working with riders to access the flow state and peak performance more often and for longer because Flow is a science and when you know what creates it for you, you can get into that space every time you are on track.

Just wrapped up reviewing your Rider Performance Assessment — and honestly, you’re already operating in a growth mindset which is a great place to start. All in All it’s a strong profile.

But here’s what stood out:

🎯 Your Goal: Win the championship
❗ Biggest obstacle? Your rival.

You’re not dealing with lapses in focus, poor prep, or lack of effort — you’ve got all of that covered. What you need now is the final 5% — the mental system that consistently keeps you calm, fast, and dangerous when it counts most… especially when he’s ahead of you on the timing sheet.

Here’s your breakdown:

🧠 Mindset – 100%
Dialled in. You reset fast, learn from mistakes, and back yourself with effort. There’s nothing fragile about your mental game — now it’s about sharpening it into a weapon.

⚙️ Preparation – 88%
Routine is there. You rehearse, you prep, you adjust. Small upgrade? Lock in recovery habits to fully reset between sessions — so every outing is a fresh strike.

🌊 Flow – 75%
You’ve built that “on rails” feel. But you’re still overthinking in some race moments, and under pressure — the final click into autopilot isn’t always instant. Let’s install a pre-race protocol that flips that switch without fail.

📈 Feedback – 79%
You reflect, you adjust, you improve. The one area to weaponize? Aggression. If you're holding back moves that could rattle your rival — that’s the zone we train next.

That’s exactly what we focus on in the Flow Performance Library Access — helping serious racers like you develop a championship-grade system for executing under pressure, holding confidence deep into race day, and turning every challenge (including rivals) into fuel 🏁

How was Morgan Park for you? 
There are many tracks that you need to find your flow on to go well, but finding flow can be difficult.

Over the past 7 seasons, I have been working with riders to access the flow state and peak performance more often and for longer because Flow is a science. When you know what creates it for you, you can get into that space every time you are on track. 

If you are interested in knowing more, click on the link and learn more about flow and how to access it in your racing  www.rideinthezone.com/topstep",,http://www.rideinthezone.com/topstep,FALSE,FALSE,,,

Not sure if you know — I’m a Flow Performance Coach. A bit different from the usual rider-coach.

I work with riders in many championships on the mental side of racing — helping them access the Flow State, where performance becomes automatic, consistent, and confident under pressure.

I’ve built a free post-race assessment tool that shows exactly where your gains are hiding — and how to unlock them in time for the next round.

Inside, I walk through the 4 pillars of peak performance — the same system riders at every level (from club to world stage) use to gain the mental edge.

🚨 But here’s the thing:
Watching is just step one.
The real shift happens when you complete the 5-minute Rider Performance Assessment.

It shows you exactly what's working, what’s not, and where you're losing time or consistency — often in ways you’ve never considered.

What if you could upgrade your confidence to go faster — just like you upgrade your bike? 🏍️

If you’ve ever felt that split-second hesitation, the second-guessing, or that little voice in your helmet saying “Any faster through Turn 1 and you're going to crash” — that’s the mindset leak that costs you seconds (and positions).

I’m opening a few End of Season Review spots for riders who want to find and fix those leaks before next season.

In the Review, you’ll get your Performance X-Ray — showing exactly where confidence, focus, or flow are breaking down — plus your Champion’s Roadmap to fix it this winter.

Want to see how it works and grab one of the spots?",Craig Muirhead,,FALSE,FALSE,,,

Just circling back in case you missed it— The riders who have already jumped into the End of Season Review this week and said it completely changed how they’re approaching the off-season.

One messaged me after saying,
“I finally get why I tense up — now I’ve got a clear plan to fix it.”

It’s honestly the best prep you can do before next season.
