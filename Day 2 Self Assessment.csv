I remember locking my eyes on his rear tire and I told myself ""just maintain the gap to his tire, nothing more, nothing less is required."" Somehow, my brain just went blank... quiet. I didn't even know what turn we were in. I had no fear of crashing. I wasn't trying to remember what gear I was in. I wasn't reminding myself to go faster or criticizing myself for not going faster. And that was the fastest I have ever gone on that bike at that track, a new PR by 2 full seconds, which I have sadly never been able to repeat. Not during a track day, not during qualifying, and not during a race, despite suspension upgrades, changing tire manufacturers, and even buying a new faster bike.",8,"I've done everything: watching YouTube videos, using a GoPro and studying every angle of my body position, spending thousands of dollars on coaching and race schools. What I've come to realize is that not everything resonates with me. But the lessons that do help me to improve, I am quite good at retaining them, and also good at letting go of information and techniques that don't work. Basically, I go to the ""all you can eat buffet"" of performance improvement, I put a little of everything on my plate, sample all the flavors, then I go back for a second or third helping of the entrees that make me happy, then I keep consuming and trying to get the desired results until I just want to throw up and never eat again...",1,Self-funded.,£1000 - £2500,FLOW,"First, I was a very talented musician, then a successful marathon runner, then a rock climber, and an ice hockey goalie, and I am also an attorney. I have the intelligence and mental fortitude and body awareness to do challenging things - all of which have been ""non-life or death"" activities. Overcoming the fear of a hockey puck coming directly at my face, that was difficult, and I was proud of myself for doing it. But when I'm racing, the risk is so much greater, so I am constantly weighing risk versus reward. When I am on track, I think about ALL the things and the faster I go, the faster I try to think about hitting my marks, steering inputs, tire grip, other racers, my lap time, their lap time...","I'm the one who taught my boyfriend how to ride a motorcycle, and he has since set lap records and won championships. The more he has won and the more I have been stuck at my plateau, the less fun I am having. Frequently I feel I am simply attending race weekends with the mindset of a participant, not a racer, because if I keep my expectations low, then I am bound to feel less disappointed in myself.  For his sake, I do try my best to be supportive and (pretend) to have fun. I believe having all the pillars would restore the joy I used to feel at the track. Even if these pillars don't improve my racing performance, I would truly like to gain better control of my mindset because that is a skill which I believe can be applied to many other areas of life both on and off the track.","I certainly don't expect to become a professional racer, but I have reached or exceeded the top 12% of everything else I've ever done in my life (law school, the Badwater Ultramarathon, CrossFit, rock climbing, ice hockey). Not being able to get to a place that I know I am capable of getting to, it has carved a void into me and caused me to doubt myself. Especially considering I experienced the flow once before on the bike and confirmed that I do have the potential. Performing at my full potential on purpose, not merely by luck, would be so fulfilling, it would restore joy during the race weekends that have become so important to my boyfriend, and it would repair a rift that has begun to creep between us. Honestly, even if my racing results did not improve, just being able to master my mindset would be a bigger victory than any amount of prize money or championships.",8,I would move from approximately 10th place to at least 5th place or better in most of my races. It would mean that I would consider participating in more races and perhaps even exploring additional race organizations at other tracks.,Other (specify below),Pretty much all of them.,10,"As previously mentioned, when I achieved my PR during a track weekend while following my heavier but faster boyfriend on a slower bike.",10,"I have been exploring coaches and racing schools since 2015. That is 10 years and a lot of money for very minimal returns thus far. If this doesn't work, I will probably quit racing and enjoy all the money I will be saving then moving someplace that does not have any race tracks and exploring new boring hobbies like knitting.","To feel more in control of my mindset, and no longer hear the negative, not good enough, not fast enough, don't crash, oh completely missed that apex, set up needs work, these tires might be done, drunken monkey voices.","Ten years, seven bikes, three championships. It would be a bitter pill to swallow, but I would find a way to enjoy not racing anymore by taking up a completely new activity which would be very difficult due to how successful my boyfriend is at racing and in 12 months, he will still want to go to many track days and race weekends.",FLOW.,I am committed to tuning in tomorrow for the third lesson.,Definitely attending - I'm ready for the complete solution,completed,2026-01-08 06:00:39,,2026-01-08 07:32:40,7ee787dbe3,,"Thanks for completing this typeform

However I have mental blocks when riding that prevent me from going outside of my riding 'safe zone'. I literally struggle to let off the brakes a bit earlier, or tip in a bit faster. I believe some of it is a fear of crashing, not for any injury but for the cost of it. I also don't natually find it easy to do something I haven't done before, i.e. roll in quicker or turn faster.

mcbpe6x4d6piyt1jumcbpe6uxcv2pi98,Ty,Henriksen,tyhenriksenracing@gmail.com,No - I understand mental architecture is essential for consistent performance,No - I understand I need to take systematic action to change my results,10,I would say my mindset is very good I’m very open to learn and listen but as soon as I start to see on the pitwall that I’m dropping in position I forget all about what I was actually going out to do and stress trying to go faster into corners with result in my coming to fast in and miss the exit point. I always hope I can make some changes to myself to stress less but it end up with me thinking more about it kinda like you said with the drunken monkey that there’s always the voice and criticism in your head doubting if you should really be here. But it has gotten a lot better over the years and especially since this season start I started from the first race which was also my first time ever riding the bike when the others have been training in Spain and I was almost about to get kicked home again we took it to us and learned from that weekend and race after I was already up in P5 making points and but after that I couldn’t really teach my self to progress more and could only do P4 and mostly P6-7.,9,I tend to overthink alot which leads to me dropping a lot in lap times but then I start to tell my self to just ride and relax and have fun then suddenly I’m up in good lap times again and even sometimes progress even more,9,First when I come in I sit for 10 min just by my self to cool off and then talk with my data man and talk about the feeling on the bike and look what I can do better then I sit 45 min before every session to study track map and take small steps at a time,5,"I was a Most very excited to start the weekend first free practice when really good was up in P6 if I remember correctly and then second practice I dropped down to 11th place again which made me stress alot I went to take a bath in the lake nearby and went to sleep next day I had some problems again in Q1 and I chose to not sit down think to much of it as I know if I think to much then the outcome will be bad and in Q2 I was P7.

Next day in race 1 I was fully prepared first race went better than planned I came 3 in first corner and then 3 corners after I got overtaken and dropped to P4 again had some fights with another rider fighting for the fourth place and we almost made a collision in the second last corner because of I saw a gap I wanted to take it as I thought it was the best place to overtake strategically and I was to hard on the brakes while he was already turning in but I secured it which made me feel motivated for the last race.

Second race I was overthink alot due to a sidecar spilling oil on over half of the track. In the first few rounds I was too scared to touch it and I went from P4 to P10 but then I thought I didn’t have anything to loose and I fought all the way up again to P6 in the last lap where I was about to overtake P5 and 4 I made a crucial mistake on the oil spot which lead me to highside and  didn’t finish 

But overall that weekend has been the best ever I have never felt so good on the bike as in that moment",8,I would say it’s good,3,I seek sponsorships daily but it’s always the same reply that they only wanna sponsor local soccer as they don’t get anything from being shown in other country’s. So right now it’s my dad funding it all,,SPONSORSHIP,Because of lack of sponsors I’m competing against world championship teams and riders without a team and this makes me stress a lot more because it’s me and my dad having to stress about putting tires on and off and fixing the whole bike in between every session I never have time to just sit down relax and think about what really to do in the next sessions and I always think about if I crash now that I might not be able to race for a while,I have always been told since I was racing Ohvale world championship and World championship pocket bike that I could go really far but because of the lack of sponsors as mentioned before I have been stressing a lot so with sponsors means I would be able to make them rise heavily,It would feel that this was the right decision to keep on going and that finally see what people have always told me,1,It would mean I would finally be fighting for the podium wins almost every race weekend and finally wining the championship,That rider is faster than you'll ever be,,8,Schleiz where I wasn’t even thinking about what I was doing the only thing in mind was that I should have fun which made me achieve my first ever P5,10,I have no fear in only fear if I don’t do it that I will never really learn to relax in my body and really reaching the goals everybody says I can go for,That I would be fighting for the podium next year,I would still be in the middle field where i am now maybe even slower,funding,Learning more about my body to relax it,Definitely attending - I'm ready for the complete solution,completed,2025-11-04 23:41:58,,2025-11-05 00:16:28,79f846ceed,,"Thanks for completing this typeform

I get a drunken monkey and sometime feel that I'm not good enough. I constantly think about what I need to do to get better and win. I need to work on my mental and be confident. Confidence is my biggest problem area. I do get frustrated when I'm pushing hard and don't get to the top of the leaderboards.,6,Overthinking and lack of confidence,7,"I watch over the last year's / previous sessions for the class and see what the top guys were doing on track to get to the top times. I write it down on my trackmaps and compare what they do to what i do. I go over it one last time in my mind where I need to improve from last session. I stretch, and do a light jog to get myself loose and my heart rate up.",8,When I started in 16th at New jersey and it rained 1 hour before the race. I stayed calm checked out the track on the sighting lap and it was pretty much fully dry. I gotba great start and focused on myself and stayed aggressive. I caught up to the group with the defending and current champion and the rider that was 3 points ahead of me in the championship as well as a few others. We battled for 7th and I passed them in corners I wasn't confident in earlier in the weekend. Everything felt easier to do and it was a close fight to the line. I finished 8th after starting 16th.,7,"I write what I did on a trackmap then look where I ended up in the session. I check the sector times of people who went quicker then me from 0.5 of a second, to 1 second quicker, then work up to the first place rider. Then I look at the video of the session and see what other riders are doing that I need to improve on. From there I make a plan on what I need to do and I focus on the sectors I'm struggling in. And still try to improve on my good sectors. But I like to break the track down and focus on my biggest struggle points and work from there.",4,As of now it's mainly my parents that fund the racing. I try to reach out to possible sponsors in racing as well as possible hometown sponsors. I send them an email and explain what I do and the class I race in. And how I would love to work with them. I send them my resume in the email as well.,,MINDSET,"I struggle with confidence on and off the track. I've been working on it but it's definitely my weakest pillar. I also overthink alot about what I need to do in each session, and how to improve.","Mindset- If I had the confidence I would be more aggressive and naturally not overthink about what I'm doing or what I need to do. Trusting in my abilities as a rider.
Preparation- if I improved my preparation I would feel more ready less nervous going on track. I would know I'm completely prepared and ready to go on track.
Flow- if I found flow every time I was on the bike. I wouldn't overthink and overwork myself or overpush. Letting everything come to me and being one with the bike. I think every session would be improved from practice to the races.
Feedback- if I came back after every session and better analyzed what I did in each session. I would know exactly what I need to improve on in the next session and I would be fully prepared and confident for my next time out.
Funding- if I had the complete funding coming into the season I  would feel more at ease. I would just focus on my riding, preping, mindset, and training. Not worrying about wheather we can afford to practice or fix broken parts.","I would feel I sence of relief, and happiness. I would have confidence going into every weekend knowing I can do everything the other riders can do. However, I would not be satisfied with just being at the front. Because there's always something you can do to get better. I want to win so badly, so if I could perform to my true potential it would mean so much to me. And I would not settle but continue to try  and win and live my dream of becoming a world champion.",2,,You don't belong in this group,,5,In barber I had a rough qualifying and qualified 15th. It was raining in the race but I stayed calm and got a great start. From there I made my way through the field not over riding or overthinking. I felt like  one with the bike. I was running in 3rd with 2 laps to got but a red flag came out and the reverted it to the last lap putting me in 4th. It was unfortunate not to get my first professional podium. But I know it is very possible for me to podium now.,10,Failing or not getting better. If I do all of this and I still can't improve on track.,To see great progress and turn it into great results.
